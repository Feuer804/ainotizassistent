  "summary": "This document is an Xcode project file (`project.pbxproj`) for the `AINotizassistent` project. It defines the project's structure, targets, build configurations (Debug and Release), and references to source files. The project appears to be a macOS application written in Swift.",

        "issue": "The macOS deployment target is set to 10.15 Catalina (released 2019). This is an older macOS version. While it allows compatibility with older systems, it might restrict the use of newer APIs and features available in more recent macOS versions, which could be relevant for an AI-focused application."

        "issue": "The project is configured to use Swift 5.0 (released 2019). This is an significantly outdated Swift version. Using an old Swift version can lead to compatibility issues with modern libraries, prevent access to new language features, and potentially result in less optimized code compared to more recent Swift versions."
