  "summary": "This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to build a macOS application named 'AI Notizassistent'. It triggers on pushes and pull requests to the 'main' branch, as well as manually via `workflow_dispatch`. The build process runs on a `macos-13` runner, checks out the repository, configures Xcode 15, builds the application in Release configuration without code signing, zips the resulting `.app` file, and uploads both the `.zip` and `.app` files as a build artifact named 'AINotizassistent-macOS'. A summary is provided at the end indicating success and download location.",
